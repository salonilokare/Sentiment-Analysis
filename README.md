# Sentiment-Analysis
The primary goal is to develop a sentiment analysis model that can accurately classify the sentiment of text data, providing valuable insights into public opinion, customer feedback, and social media trends.

1. Project Overview
This project performs sentiment analysis on text data to determine emotional tone (positive, negative, or neutral). Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models, the goal is to classify text sentiment and present results visually for actionable insights.

2. Objectives
Analyze text to detect sentiment polarity.
Apply NLP techniques for text processing.
Use machine learning algorithms for classification.
Perform feature engineering for better accuracy.
Visualize sentiment trends and distribution.

3. Steps Performed
a. Sentiment Analysis:
Collected and preprocessed text data from the source.Classified sentiment into positive, negative, or neutral categories.
b. Natural Language Processing (NLP):
Tokenized text into words for analysis.Removed stopwords, punctuation, and performed stemming/lemmatization.Converted text into numerical format using techniques like TF-IDF or Word2Vec.
c. Machine Learning Algorithms:
Implemented models such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Logistic Regression for classification.Tested deep learning architectures (e.g., LSTM, BERT) for improved accuracy.Evaluated models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
d. Feature Engineering:
Extracted features such as n-grams, sentiment lexicons, and part-of-speech tags.Selected most relevant features to enhance model performance and reduce overfitting.
e. Data Visualization:
Created bar charts, pie charts, and word clouds to display sentiment distribution.Visualized trends over time to detect sentiment shifts.

4. Tools & Technologies:
Python (NLTK, spaCy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch, matplotlib, seaborn, wordcloud)
Jupyter Notebook for analysis and model building.

5. Outcomes:
Accurate sentiment classification of text data.
Insights into emotional tone and public opinion.
Visual reports for easier decision-making.

6. How to Run
Install Python 3.8+ and required libraries from requirements.txt.
Open Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
Run all cells to preprocess text, train models, and view results.
